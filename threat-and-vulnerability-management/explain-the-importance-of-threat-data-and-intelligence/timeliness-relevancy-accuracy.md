# Timeliness, Relevancy, Accuracy

**Timeliness**

&#x20;Intelligence sources must be up to date. Threats diminish, change, and evolve. Adversary groups adopt different tactics. You must assess whether an intelligence source can research and disseminate updates in a timely manner.

**Relevancy**

&#x20;Intelligence sources must match their use case. Example: a threat intelligence source that focuses on Windows security is of limited use if your systems are primarily cloud applications accessed via Chrome OS workstations.

**Accuracy**&#x20;

Intelligence sources must produce effective results. Accuracy can also refer to whether the intelligence is of a general or specific nature.
