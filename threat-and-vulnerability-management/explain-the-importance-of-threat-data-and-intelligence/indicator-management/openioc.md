# OpenIoC

OpenIOC uses XML-formatted documents. Each entry comprises meta-information such as author, category information, confidence level, and usage license, plus a description and a definition. The definition is built from logical statements defining detection rules, such as DNS host name or a string pattern for a filename.&#x20;

Malware Information Sharing Project (MISP) [https://www.misp-project.org/](https://www.misp-project.org/) provides a server platform for CTI sharing as well as a file format. MISP servers can import and export STIX CDOs over TAXII.&#x20;

It also supports OpenIOC definitions.
