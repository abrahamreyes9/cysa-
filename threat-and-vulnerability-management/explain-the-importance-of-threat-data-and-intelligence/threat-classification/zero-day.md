# Zero-day

A zero-day is a vulnerability that is discovered or exploited before the vendor can issue a patch to fix it.&#x20;

Security researchers who discover new vulnerabilities should inform the vendor privately and allow time for a fix to be developed before making the vulnerability public. The time allowed is often 90 days by convention, but this may be reduced depending on the status of the vulnerability.&#x20;

Zero-day vulnerabilities have significant financial value. Consequently, an adversary will only use a zero-day vulnerability for high-value attacks. State security and law enforcement agencies are known to stockpile zero days to facilitate the investigation of crimes.
