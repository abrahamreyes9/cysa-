# 1.5 Explain the threats and vulnerabilities associated with specialised technology

* Mobile: malware; unpatched devices; jailbreaking; data leaks; OS vulnerabilities
* IoT: weak passwords; insecure services; lack of security update; outdated component use; insecure data transfer/storage; lack of secure/physical device management
* Embedded: programming errors; web vulnerability; weak access control/authentication
* RTOS: RCE; DoS; information leak; improper access control
* SoC: low-level hardware bugs (boot header modification; partition header table parsing)
* FPGA: fault injection; hardware trojans; design leaks; foundry fabrication
* Physical access control: insufficient access control; lack of training; unattended assets
* Building automation systems: hardcoded secret; BOF; XSS; path traversal; auth bypass
* Vehicles and drones:
  * CAN bus: DoS; unauthorized remote access
* Workflow and process automation systems: 3rd party platform vulnerabilities; IAM issue
* ICS: improper credentials management; weak firewall rules; network design weaknesses
* SCADA:
  * Modbus: plaintext transmission; no authentication; command injection; weak sessions
