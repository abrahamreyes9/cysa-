# 1.2 Given a scenario, utilise threat intelligence to support organisational security

* Attack frameworks:
* MITRE ATT\&CK: tactics & techniques in developing threat models and methodologies
* The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis: intelligence on network intrusion events using 4 elements (adversary, capability, infrastructure, victim)
* Kill chain: visibility into attack; reconnaissance -> weaponisation -> delivery -> exploitation -> installation -> C2 -> actions on objectives
* Threat research:
  * Reputational: detects threats with IP/domain/file reputations
  * Behavioural: detects unknown threats based on their behaviour
  * IOC: forensic data that identify potentially malicious activity on systems/networks
  * CVSS: measure severity of security flaws (AV, AC, Au, C, I, A)
* Threat modelling methodologies:
  * Adversary capability: adversarial toolsets/skillsets/evasion techniques
  * Total attack surface: total of all different attack vectors an attacker can exploit
  * Attack vector: describes how an attack can exploit the vulnerability
  * Impact: magnitude of adverse impact on organisation
  * Likelihood: likelihood that threat source will initiate risk & likelihood that the risk has adverse effects on the organisation
* Threat intelligence sharing with supported functions
  * Incident response: detect threats quicker, less disruptively prevent attacks, respond quicker to adversaries
  * Vulnerability management: provides context by identifying exploits and adding to vulnerabilities list
  * Risk management: rapidly receive and use actionable data about latest threats
  * Security engineering: adapt to emerging threats
  * Detection and monitoring: update signature database, monitor/detect new threats
